#AirBnb : The consoel
    put in place a parent class (called BaseModel) to take care of the initialization, serialization and deserialization of your future instances
    create a simple flow of serialization/deserialization: Instance <-> Dictionary <-> JSON string <-> file
    create all classes used for AirBnB (User, State, City, Place…) that inherit from BaseModel
    create the first abstracted storage engine of the project: File storage.
    create all unittests to validate all our classes and storage engine

What’s a command interpreter?

Do you remember the Shell? It’s exactly the same but limited to a specific use-case. In our case, we want to be able to manage the objects of our project:

    Create a new object (ex: a new User or a new Place)
    Retrieve an object from a file, a database etc…
    Do operations on objects (count, compute stats, etc…)
    Update attributes of an object
    Destroy an object
